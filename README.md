# Japanese Vocabulary Learning Guide

Welcome to the Japanese Vocabulary Learning Guide! This repository provides a structured and comprehensive collection of Japanese vocabulary designed to help you master the language through daily practice and contextual understanding.

---

## Overview

This guide is organized into daily vocabulary sets, each focusing on a new collection of words. Every vocabulary entry includes:

* **Word (Romaji):** The word written in Romaji for easy pronunciation.
* **Kanji/Kana:** The word presented in its Japanese script (Kanji with Furigana or Hiragana/Katakana).
* **Meaning:** A clear English translation of the word.
* **English Example:** An example sentence in English to illustrate usage.
* **Romaji Example:** The example sentence in Romaji.
* **Japanese Example:** The example sentence in Japanese script.

The goal is to provide enough context for each word so you can understand its usage patterns and remember it more effectively.

## How to Use This Guide

To get the most out of this vocabulary collection, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Navigate to Daily Sets:** Start with `day-01.md` and progress through the subsequent `day-XX.md` files. Each file represents a focused daily learning session.
2.  **Review Each Entry:** For each word, carefully read its meaning, and then study the example sentences in English, Romaji, and Japanese. Try to understand the context in which the word is used.
3.  **Active Recall:** Don't just read! Try to recall the meaning of the word before looking at it, or try to construct your own simple sentences using the new vocabulary.
4.  **Consistency is Key:** Aim to review 3-5 words each day from the current set, or dedicate a set amount of time to learning new words. Regular, short study sessions are more effective than infrequent, long ones.

## Study Tips

Enhance your learning with these proven strategies:

* **Practice Daily:** Consistency is crucial. Even a short 15-minute session can make a significant difference over time.
* **Use Flashcards:** Create digital (e.g., Anki) or physical flashcards for active recall. Include the Japanese word on one side and the meaning/example on the other.
* **Context Learning:** Always pay attention to the example sentences. Understanding words in context helps them stick better than memorizing isolated terms.
* **Spaced Repetition:** Regularly revisit older vocabulary. Tools like Anki can help automate this process, showing you words just as you're about to forget them.
* **Speaking Practice:** Try to incorporate new words into simple sentences when speaking (even if it's just to yourself!). This helps solidify your understanding and pronunciation.
* **Listen Actively:** When consuming Japanese media (anime, dramas, podcasts), try to spot the vocabulary you've learned.
